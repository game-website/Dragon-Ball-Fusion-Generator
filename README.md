Dragon Ball Fusion History
The concept of fusing warriors debuted in Dragon Ball Z during the Buu saga, when Goku and Vegeta used the Potara earrings to merge into Vegito. The popularity of character fusions exploded after Dragon Ball Fusions launched for the Nintendo 3DS, letting fans fuse any character.
